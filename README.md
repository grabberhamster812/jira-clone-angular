It is still <u>under development</u>. I am planning to build it in about two weeks (13 - 27 Jun 2020) in my spare time. After finished coding, I will gradually publish a series of tutorial how I built it from scratch.

Thanks for visiting.

## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I do Angular development and this is a showcase product I've built in my spare time to experiment the new library that I wanted to try before: Akita, TailwindCSS, ng-zorro.

This project is basically a clone of another open source Jira clone build in `React` and `VueJS` (you could say a clone of a clone I know). I though it would be a great candidate of a modern, real-world Angular codebase and it really helps me to strengthen my knowledge of Angular as well.

There are many showcase/example Angular projects out there but most of them are way too simple. I like to think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to Angular developers of all skill levels while still being _relatively_ easy to understand. Plus, working with interactive UI is very exciting comparing to a simple CRUD form or a shopping cart application.

## Features

- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- All code are written in TypeScript
- Project setup with Angular CLI
- Use Akita state management
- Use TailwindCSS

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/trungk18/jira-clone-angular.git`
- `npm run install-dependencies`
- `cd frontend && npm start`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:4200/`

## What's missing?

There are features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product:

### Proper backend API

I am currently using a `json` file for storing data. I am planning to write a graphQL API soon in order to learn more about that.

### Proper authentication system üîê

I am currently auto create an auth token and seed a project with issues and users for anyone who visits the API without valid credentials. In a real product you have to to implement a proper [email and password authentication system](https://www.google.com/search?q=email+and+password+authentication+node+js&oq=email+and+password+authentication+node+js).

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators etc. Most early stage companies tend to ignore this aspect of their product but in many cases they shouldn't, especially once their userbase starts growing.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I skipped writing test for this project. I will do it for the backend API.
